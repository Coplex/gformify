gformify
======

WordPress Plugin that adds Bootstrap v3.3.1 styling and syntax to Gravity Forms Plugin

###What this plugin does:

+ Loads Bootstrap v3.3.1 basic styles
+ Loads Gravity Form specific bootstrap styles
+ Adds proper Bootstrap classes to relevant Gravity Form DOM elements

###How to use
Upload the plugin to WordPress.  Disable css output in gravity forms settings/

###ToDo
1. This plugin currently auto enqueues bootstrap v3.3.1.   This will eventually be conditionally loaded
2. Gulp configuration is not working as of yet so raw less is being passed around
